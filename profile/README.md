# KarmaCart: Demo Web Application

---

## Introduction

Welcome to KarmaCart, a web application developed as a learning project to explore new technologies and promote sustainable shopping practices. With KarmaCart, I aimed to create a functional prototype that demonstrates my skills as a developer while addressing real-world challenges in sustainability.

## Demo
**Show gif of demo here**

## Technology Stack

KarmaCart was built using a modern and robust technology stack, including:

- **Frontend**: React, JavaScript, Ant Design
- **Backend**: Node, TypeScript
- **IaC**: AWS CDK
- **AWS Services**: CloudFront, S3, API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB
- **AI Consultation**: GPT-4

## Architecture

## Skills Utilized

Through KarmaCart, I aimed to showcase the following key skills and competencies:

- **Full-stack Development**: Demonstrated proficiency in both frontend and backend development, from designing a user interfaces to implementing server-side logic.

- **API Integration**: Successfully integrated external APIs in AWS API Gateway and AWS Lambda, showcasing my ability to work with third-party services to enhance application functionality.

- **Responsive Design**: Ensured optimal user experience across various devices and screen sizes through responsive design principles and mobile-first development approach.

## Reflect

While KarmaCart is a successful demo web application, if I was to implement something similar again I would:

- **TSX Frontend**: Write front-end in in TypeScript (TSX) making it easier to develop in the various layers of the application (Backend and IaC code being in TypeScript).
- **Structure CSS**: Find a better pattern for structuring the CSS. With it being a small application it was manageable to include inline CSS but if this were to scale it would be difficult to manage.
- **Relational DB**: Experiment with a serverless relational DB for more flexibility. DynamoDB suits a use case where performance is more critical and a sacrafices flexibility.
- **Better Barcode Scanner**: While the barcode scanner library I chose works, it is not very flexible and has low performance when used on a low quality camera. Creating a barcode scanner from a lower level api might suit the applications needs better.
